# Train-Tracker

This SwiftUI application allows users to view real-time positions of CTA ‘L’ trains using the [Chicago Transit Authority Train Tracker API](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/ttdocs/#locations).

> 🚨 **Note:** The API key has been removed from the project for security reasons. You'll need to generate your own key to run the app.
